                I was not sure if I should actually confess but after asking your time when you would be alone 
                and then saying something stupid would have not made sense, so that night when you were available, 
                I confessed my feelingsðŸ¥¹.</p>

                the uncertainty, and the hope. When you said "yes", to the poem, it felt like the world had shifted into place. 
                While you took 2 days to think you sent me every photo of yours that were clicked on your tour.</p>

                pain, day 1 of your periods. My strong girl, as we left from apetite we walked to the station while

            <p>Firstly, The photo used for this memory has no context, but I wanted this to be included because it's one of my favourite khikhikhiiii.
                In this time period shared a precious bond, learning about each other's dreams, fears, and 
                everything in between, we shared snaps we had fun, faced challenges and overcame it. Then we planned our date in Diwali 
                after canceling it twice, we finally went on a date on Saturday, 11th November, 2023. A day to always remember!!.

                We kept planning for our 2nd date, and finally, we went to Gateway of India, Colaba. We were trying to find a place to kiss, the image  for this memory is just the moment after that forehead kiss, a beautiful memory captured forever.
                2 people in love, sharing a moment that felt like it was just for us, then we went to queen's necklace, sat there, and talked about everything and nothing at the same time.
                While leaving we had a little walk before we went to CST, I was so happy that day, I still remember the way you smiled at me, 
                the way you looked at me, and the way you made me feel.</p>

            reception, we were trying to manage it's damn rotation and size lmao, 6 Damn!!! hours for figuring out a bookshelf. It was 
            so damn crazy and fun, we were laughing at how we were struggling with it, later we decided to call it a day. WOW! it was such a great time we spent together.

            <p>
             After a week of working hard on the thesis, staying up late everyday to a minimum of 2 AM, We managed to complete the gryffindor 
             common room of your restaurant. After so many efforts on thesis and as we could not meet on your birthday, we wanted to meet even if it's for a few hours, so after cancelling
             and postponing twice we finally met on 25th November, this time we took a bus to Marine Drive first, This was our first time sitting in a double
             decker bus, you slept on my shoulder like a baby, I was caressing your hair, later we got down and just sat there together just to enjoy that calm 
            nature we stayed silent for some time, I kept my head on your shoulder and felt so much of peace I cant explain, then as the time was running, 
            we got up and wanted to at least get a long hug and a kiss so we were again on our way to find a place, Then walked all the way to 
                Gateway of India, That time was so beautiful, we talked about the cats that climbed up to your house everyday and you and kaka kaku also got attached to the cats
            and how that BOKA did what he did, you all were sad. After the story was over, Tere shoe lace khul gaye lol, cuteee my babyyy! After all that it was time to go home, we did not want to 
            but we had to, this time we did not order 2 sandwiches lol, and got in a taxi for station and the date was over. BEAUTIFUL DAY!

             A normal day just working on the project, Our views were almost done(or so we thought), you were doing your CAD work that day,
             and our cute paddhat of keeping camera on when one of is on break, at 4 PM we decided to take a long break after all that work,
             we both just sat there for an hour looking at each other just blushing completely teasing each other on text, making each other blush more
             while trying our best to not get caught while smiling so it had to be kept under control. It was the most amazing moment we had!!!!!

               that crazy wall and the hand made snake, Crazy, for me this month's highlight was your 3 day exam, you were helping your group with views instead of studying,
               I was very proud of you, then you were literally sleepy during the exam which gave us "I am real", "Inki Pinki Ponki" and "A1 Cartridge" SOOO 
               Cute that was!!!!, then you had 3 days of jury when I decided to surprise at the station by being there,, as usual you could not find me khikhikhiiii
               you were happy to see me, then the next day you brought me Fried rice and fed it to me by your handsðŸ¥¹ðŸ¥¹.

            <p>
                Your college had informed you that you need to start the internship by January, this was the interview phase-1 
                your nervousness was so cute, you were so scared that you would not get the internship, I accompanied you to the Sion wala interview
                We reached there early we had a little walk, then you went for the interview, it was good but you were disappointed as 
                the person did not give you hope, I was sad to see you like that, but you were so strong you did not give up, on 27th December,
                you called me after you had cried a lot, you were afraid everyone from boba got the internship but not you, you called me 
                we had a nice conversation, I told you that you are the best and you will get it, you had calmed down, later that night I went on terrace,
                to send voice notes to you, I started Singing which made you laugh, then kaka asked you "sandhyakali tar radat hoti aata kay zala itki hastey?"
                and that's how we ended your sad day with a good laughter and smile.

                All the relatives were at your places for new year celebration, and unfortunately we could not meet, we were just having conversations
                whenever we could, the time was difficult, we were missing each other so much, there were not enough chances for us to talk,
                yet we managed it, the cutest gesture of that day was when you had another rented room and you went in there alone just so we could talk,
                because you missed me so much you "could not hold back" it honestly made me emotional and happy at the same time, I was so happy that you cared so much about me,
                and that was the end of 2023's memories. KHIKHIKHIIIII!
